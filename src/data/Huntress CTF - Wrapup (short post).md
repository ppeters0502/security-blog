## Intro
Hello Internet!
As I mentioned in my [last two posts](https://screamintothevoid.today/blog/10), some of my coworkers and I are participating as a CTF team in John Hammond's [Huntress CTF Tournament](https://huntress.ctf.games/)! Since I've been a little neglectful on posting regularly to this site, I thought it might be a good idea to continue posting about our team's progress in this month long CTF!

## Final results
So right from about day 4 or so onwwards, I realized that tracking all of the challenges on this blog was going to be tricky... The challenges ramped up in difficulty pretty quickly, and Sometimes the process of trying to recreate one of the challenges if one of my coworkers solved it was rather difficult. Balance that out with still staying on top of my full time work, and the cloudsec training I'm currently doing in AWS (see my [earlier post](https://screamintothevoid.today/blog/9) on certifications), and I was quickly drowning in writeups! So needless to say, despite my best efforts to circumvent my own procrastination, I didn't get writeups done on everything. 

Our team still did fairly well, all things considered, and this was our progress after the last day of the CTF (FYI, my user was SkyWisd0m, special shoutout to xdp_tx for carrying the team!):
![3627f8ff96f3a3c273000b5dab5a52aa.png](https://i.imgur.com/d8K2EUq.png)We solved every challenge (of the around 57 or so challenges) that was presented except for the last 7 challenges which were on the last week. This was mostly because our team was pretty overloaded on the last week of October with Security Awareness presentations, other client work, and family obligations.
We still got a neat little certificate from Huntress that I'll proudly display!

## Wrapping up the year
So with Cybersecurity Awareness month wrapped, and now being a week into November, I'm starting to get the itches to finish some of my year long goals. This means really buckling down to focus on certifications over the next couple months, and hopefully get some of that done before the end of the year!
So you might see a post or two from me as I make more progress studying up for the [cloud practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) exam!

Short post this time, but expect some longer posts in the future.
See you later!
