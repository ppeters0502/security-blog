## Intro
Hello Internet!
Quick blurb to keep me honest, but made more progress with comments!

For the obligatory recap, as mentioned in my original post [original post](https://screamintothevoid.today/blog/13) I'm working on a challenge to spend at least an hour writing code every day for the next 100 Days! Here are the rules I'm setting myself:
* Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
* Post my progress every day on my blog.

For Day Seven, here is my GitHub Contributions Activity meter:

## What are we doing today?
Today is another day where I'm a little strapped for time, so I'm sticking pretty closely to my hour of personal coding. The goal today is to finish up the post actions on comments so that I can actually add a new comment and see it in the test JSON. If all goes to plan, I can finish that today, and then focus on the AWS side of things tomorrow!

## A little while later....
Ok, I have the post working, now comments are successfully posted to my test JSON server, and show up in the list of comments, so the React functionality is all there!

Anyways, tomorrow's probably going to be a pretty short post too since I'll be mostly working in AWS, but we're making progress!!!

See you on the next one!
