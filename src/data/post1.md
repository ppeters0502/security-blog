Hello there!
My name is Pat Peters. I've been working in the IT industry for about 10 years now (Jesus Christ, it's been 10 years....) where I worked in IT Support, Software Development, and I just recently (as of the beginning of July 2022) transferred professionally into cybersecurity (Application Security and pentesting to be specific).

While getting acquainted with my new position, I feel like I'm still very green on the technical side of Application Security. Having worked in several different sects of technology, and graduated with a Masters Degree in Cybersecurity last December, I feel fairly comfortable in the high level and abstract parts of technology and security.

To help get more comfortable in the weeds of AppSec, I started this blog to walk through some CTFs, some common security topics that are coming up recently, and just anything else I find interesting. I'm also working on this site at the same time, so you'll slowly start to see more features as I make progress. So stay tuned, and enjoy!

Here's a picture of my daughter and I eating some ice cream
