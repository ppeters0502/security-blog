## Intro (really just kind of everything)
![cb5c88e35103c5d531b0cce4923c3ac6.png](https://i.imgur.com/Lw2Lk8F.png)Hello Internet!
So it's been a few months, my apologies for the radio silence.
Without getting too deep in the weeds, had a family health scare that eventually led to a death in the family this past summer (right around when I was doing the 100 days of code), and that kind of threw a large chunk of my motivation out the window. I didn't really want to work on projects, work on career advancement, or really even look at a computer for a good while. Then this fall I kind of fell back into some non-tech related hobbies, woodworking and volunteering. The volunteering is mostly wrapped up since it was for the 2024 election, and the woodworking will pretty much be ongoing forever.

My goal is to get back into a more regular cadence with posting on this blog, so you should be seeing some continuation on my chess engine, a little bit of cloud cert efforts, and some pentesting walkthroughs as well over the next 2 months. December is always really fun for me with [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) and [Advent of Cyber](https://tryhackme.com/r/christmas) just around the corner, so who knows, maybe you'll see a post or two about that! I really want to get this post out there ASAP though, so this is just a short post to let you know I'm not dead, everything is ok with the family now, and that more posts will be coming soon!
