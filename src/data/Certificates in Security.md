## Intro
Hello Internet!
So it's been a little while since I've posted any walkthroughs, so I thought I'd leave a quick note saying I'm not dead and that more walkthroughs will be coming! The past few months I've been pretty busy with a mix of home improvement projects, trips for weddings and other family events, and most recently, diving more into certifications.

## Why Certs?
I currently have my Masters in Cybersecurity, so I took the school route instead of the certification route. Because of this, I currently don't have any of the more widely accepted security certs (OSCP, CompTIA, CISSP, etc). So one of my longer term goals (personally and professionaly) is to start working on certifications.

I still find it so backwards, the certs versus degree conversation. Like, I totally get that not everyone thrives in a school environment. I also understand that typically the private sector moves a little faster and is more up to date in education than the public university track. After getting very close to wrapping up grad school though, I was furloughed for a little while, and had used the opportunity to apply for some dev jobs and some security jobs. Multiple places wouldn't even give me a second interview since I didn't have any certifications. It's like, does this degree mean nothing???

I might be a lone voice in this opinion, but personally I got a lot of great knowledge and resources out of my time in grad school. I've heard countless developers and security folks say that degrees are overblown in their value and that a degree is "just a piece of paper" that doesn't prepare you for life outside of school. In some ways I think this might be right, if you're the type of student who only goes to class, turns in homework, takes the test, and then immediately forgets what they just learned, then yes that piece of paper didn't really help you. I feel like that exact same sentiment could be said about certifications. If I try to power through a difficult cert program as fast as possible, take the test and then move on without applying what I just learned, I feel like that cert isn't really helping me. 

In my case, along with attending classes at university, I was in a CTF and Security club at my school, participated in a few research projects with some of the professors after showing interest in their work, and was working full time while in school part time. I don't know if it was any one of those single things that made the difference, or a combination of all of those things, but for me having outside resources that enabled me to apply what I was learning while I studied was probably the most important part to my higher learning experience. I'm not sure if I would've had the same opportunities to apply that learning if I had only done the certificate route.

But anyways, that's my rant on higher education.

## Ok, so which certs then?
So when I first decided to start working on certs, the one I was most focused on was Offensive Security's OSCP certificate.

For pentesting this one seemed like the most standard cert that I was seeing on tons of job application requirements and on profiles of security professionals I look up to. I'll be honest though, I saw the price tag on the test and study material ($1,599 at the time of this post) and I got a little worried. My employer has a policy of reimbursing for certificate programs I enroll in, but the cert has to be applicable to my work (which OCSP is) and they only reimburse if I pass the test. No pressure there!

At the same time, I have two kids under the age of 6, and I'll be honest: I don't think I have the available study time in order to pass this. Especially in the categories that I'm especially weak on (privilege escalation, lateral movement) I just don't want to potentially set myself up for failure. So I'm going to start off on a couple of smaller cert programs and go from there.

I currently have a couple of security subscriptions to TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and PentesterLab, so I started looking at some of the certificates these programs offer. I've already done TryHackMe's [Jr Penetration Tester](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/jrpenetrationtester) learning path, and it looks like HackTheBox has a similar pentesting pathway and [HTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist Exam](https://academy.hackthebox.com/exams/3/) that is much more affordable and a good starting path.

Unfortunately I have to go through all of the learning modules before I can take the test, even though the first few learning modules are very similar to the TryHackMe learning path I just completed. Even with that though, the content is very well written (so far), and I think this could be a good confidence booster before trying to tackle OSCP.


## CloudSec is important too!
While getting more in depth in my security role, I've actually been finding that I don't know nearly as much about cloud computing and cloud security as I thought I did! I guess I should probably start looking at cloudsec certificates that are out there as well....

My place of employment uses multiple cloud resources, but the day to day work I do is primarily in Amazon Web Services. Looks like Amazon offers quite a few different [certificate programs](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/exams/?nc2=sb_ce_exm), and even a couple of [pathways](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs/AWS_certification_paths.pdf), including a Cloud Security Engineer pathway and Cloud Security Architect pathway!

## Conclusion
There are a ton of certificate options that are out there, and I know I barely scratched the surface on these different pathways. So along with posting CTF walkthroughs I'll post an occasional blurb about how the certification route is going, some of the key differences between the different certificates versus a traditional degree, and my overall experience.
In the meantime, guess I better go study!
