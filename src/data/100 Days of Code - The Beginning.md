## Intro
Hello Internet!

So it's been a bit since I've posted. Been very busy the past few months with a couple of work related projects, along with playing music and gardening with my family. With memorial day just behind me, I'm coming really close to my 2 year anniversary of starting this blog and making the jump from Software Development to Security.

It's been great so far, I'm learning a ton, and I really enjoy the work I get to do! Some weeks are very pentesting focused, with me trying my hardest to break things. Other weeks I'm more focused on security reviews of some of the tools and dependencies we use, and spending A LOT of time on GitHub!

To be honest though, there's one piece of my old Software Development life that I really miss.
**I really miss coding**

Don't get me wrong, I get to read lots of code everyday while reviewing open source projects. Occasionally I also get to write some scripts here and there in Python, so it's not like I'm completely languishing in my development or anything like that!

I'm missing a very specific feeling though. That feeling of being neck-deep in a webapp or service that's more complicated than a simple Python script, navigating issues and build errors, and eventually seeing your efforts actually move forward ever so slightly. **That** feeling, I don't get to see nearly as much, and I really miss it! Maybe it's nostalgia, maybe I'm not challenging myself enough, I don't know.... But right now this feeling has been leaving me in a bit of a funk. I've been looking through a couple open source projects to see if maybe I could start contributing on something, but I kind of want to start on something of my own. I have this site, and I've contributed on a couple projects like a tiny contribution to [OWASP Threat Dragon's website](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-threat-dragon) and [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp), but I kind of want it to be my own thing.

So to (hopefully) help kick this sort of effort off, I'm taking on a new challenge! 

## As of this day (May 29th, 2024), I'm publicly committing to spending at least 1 hour every day for the next 100 days writing code as part of the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) online challenge!

## How this challenge works
This challenge is pretty straightforward. The description on 100daysofcode.com say there are only two requirements:
* Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
* Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

I'll be honest, I absolutely hate X/Twitter, and tweeting my progress isn't really a motivator for me at all. So instead of tweeting my progress every day, I'm going to try and post some sort of progress everyday on this blog! I've been frustrated with myself that I haven't been posting more, and especially since I'm thinking some of my coding ventures may very well be adding features to this site, I figure it's a good place to post this progress!

## So what will I post then?
To help keep myself accountable, the main metric I'll be using will be my GitHub Contributions Activity. Some of my coding will be on this site, if I'm introducing new features, but sometimes I might be working on a separate repository, so I think starting my posts off with a quick screenshot of my contribution activity might work?

I guess this means I should start with my current activity, here's my current GitHub activity:

If you'd like to follow along at home, you can see my [GitHub profile here!](https://github.com/ppeters0502)

I can then talk a little bit about whatever I'm working on, and go from there. Since I'll be (hopefully) posting something every single day, My actual blog posts might be a little shorter so that I can get them posted to the site regularly. Then if I finish maybe a larger project or feature, I'll go more in depth on the post.

## Ok, what sort of code are you thinking of writing?
At this point I'm not 100% sure, but right now these are some of the sorts of things I might be doing:
* Adding Google Analytics to this site (seriously, I have no idea how many people visit this site, and a small part of me is wondering if I really want to know.)
* Possibly a comment section for blog posts
* A project I've contemplated starting already is some sort of chess engine.
* Contributing some bigger changes on [OWASP Threat Dragon](https://github.com/OWASP/threat-dragon)
* I had an idea for an auto-bleeper that I posted about in [open source project ideas](https://github.com/open-source-ideas/ideas/issues/381). The idea was shot down pretty quickly, but I think it sounds fun to maybe do as a personal project.
* Security Automation?
* Possible site for tracking garbage cleanup efforts (longer story there for another post)

The main point is, I have some ideas I can work with, I have a (sem-public) way of tracking my progress and keeping myself accountable. That means it's time to get this show on the road!
Thanks everyone, we'll see you on the next one!

**Post Script:** I'll post my day one in a separate post. Even though technically my blog posts show up in GitHub as "contributions", I'm not counting them in this challenge!
